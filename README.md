# bridgen

This is a plugin build for paper 1.8.8(works in 1.8.9) for bridging.

The command is /bidgen and it sets your spawn point and gives you two stacks of sandstone. If you drop the specified 5 blocks below the spawn point, you will be teleported back and all blocks placed will be deleted. Your two stacks of blocks will be replenished as well.

Very simple plugin, required [KotlinBukkitApi](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/KotlinBukkitAPI) to run on a paper server. The jar file for this can be found under the contents section of the [KotlinBukkitApi](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/KotlinBukkitAPI) github page.

That is all, gn.
